Being developed by Jonathan Eugenio and Mark Romero

Have you ever wanted to see the wavefunction for a particle in a one dimensional potential well?

Well now you can, with this app, coming soon!

## Current Features
* User defines the scenario, with the mass of the particle, the energy depth (in eV), and the half width well
* Plots each energy state with the representative wave function or density distribution function
* With Kivy, there is now a graphical interface for inputting parameters (9/6/2017)

## In Development
* Linear Potential Well, with root finder and constants defined (11/29/2017)
* LPW wavefunction plots are currently in development
* Ideally this would be ported into the Kivy interface

## Future features
* Incorporate user defined perturbations
* More particles == more fun!
* Multiple barriers
