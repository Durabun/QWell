Have you ever wanted to see the wavefunction for a particle in a one dimensional potential well?

Well now you can, with this app, coming soon!

##Current Features
* User defines the scenario, with the mass of the particle, the energy depth (in eV), and the half width well
* Plots each energy state with the representative wave function

##Future features
* Incorporate probability functions
* Incorporate user defines perturbations
* More particles == more fun!
